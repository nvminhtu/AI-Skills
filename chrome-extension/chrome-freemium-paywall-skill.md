# Chrome Extension Freemium & Paywall Strategy (S4 Edition)

## Skill Identity
**Name:** Chrome Freemium & Paywall Strategy (S4)
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Description:** Monetization logic focusing on "Value First" and "output locking". Rejects time-based trials in favor of utility-based paywalls.
**Trigger Requirements:**
- "monetize extension"
- "paywall strategy"
- "freemium model"
- "thu phí user"
- "khóa tính năng"

## 💡 The S4 Philosophy
> **"Cho user thấy value trước. Khóa đúng hành động đau nhất."**

Money is not made by asking for it upfront. Money is made by solving a problem so well that the user *can't* leave without the result.

### Core Rules
1.  **NO Time Limits:** Never use 7-day trials. Users hate them, and they are easy to bypass.
2.  **Lock Output, Not Input:** Let them *do* the work. Lock the *export* or *result*.
3.  **The "Aha!" Moment:** The user must experience the magic (the value) BEFORE hitting the paywall.

## 1. The Strategy: Lock The Output
*Let them build the house, but lock the front door key.*

### ❌ The Wrong Way:
- "Upgrade to Premium to create a project."
- "You have 3 days left of your trial."
- User installs -> Hit Paywall -> User uninstalls.

### ✅ The S4 Way:
- User installs -> User creates project -> User sees amazing result -> User clicks "Save" -> **Paywall**.
- **Psychology:** They have already invested time/effort ("Sunk Cost"). Walking away means losing their work. They pay to keep it.

## 2. The 4 Golden Paywalls

### 💎 1. The Export Paywall (Highest Conversion)
**Best for:** Scrapers, Generators, Design Tools.

**Scenario:**
- User scrapes 1,000 leads from LinkedIn. It works perfectly. They see the data snippets.
- User clicks "Download CSV".
- **Prompt:** "Free version allows viewing. Upgrade to Download CSV."

**Why it works:** The value is sitting right there. They already "have" it, they just can't "touch" it.

### 🚀 2. The Bulk Action Paywall
**Best for:** Automation, Management Tools, Batch Processors.

**Scenario:**
- User deletes 1 email. Works instantly.
- User selects 500 emails to delete.
- **Prompt:** "Free version processes 1 item at a time. Upgrade for Bulk Actions."

**Why it works:** You aren't stopping them from doing it free. You are selling them *time*. They *could* click 500 times, but they will pay $5 to save an hour.

### ♾️ 3. The Unlimited Usage Paywall
**Best for:** AI Tools, API-heavy tools.

**Scenario:**
- User generates 5 AI images. They look great.
- User tries to generate the 6th.
- **Prompt:** "Daily limit reached (5/5). Upgrade for Unlimited Generations."

**Why it works:** You hooked them with the first 5. They know it works. Now they want more.

### 💧 4. The Remove Watermark Paywall
**Best for:** Screenshots, Recorders, Content Creation.

**Scenario:**
- User records a video. It looks professional.
- The video has a giant "MADE WITH FREE EXTENSION" logo in the corner.
- **Prompt:** "Upgrade to remove watermark."

**Why it works:** Social embarrassment. They can't share professional work with a cheap watermark.

## 3. Implementation Checklist
1.  **Audit:** Where is the "Value Moment" in your extension?
2.  **Positioning:** Place the paywall *immediately after* the Value Moment.
3.  **Copy:** Don't say "Upgrade". Say "Unlock [Specific Result]".
    - *Bad:* "Upgrade to Pro"
    - *Good:* "Unlock 1-Click Export"
4.  **Free Tier:** Ensure the free tier is useful enough to get them hooked, but annoying enough (manual work, watermarks) to make them upgrade.

## Summary
**Do not sell features.**
**Sell the removal of pain.**

- Pain of losing data (Export lock).
- Pain of wasted time (Bulk lock).
- Pain of restrictions (Unlimited lock).
- Pain of unprofessionalism (Watermark lock).
