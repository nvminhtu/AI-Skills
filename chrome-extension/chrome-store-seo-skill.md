## 💡 The S4 Philosophy
> **"Không user = Không tiền" (No user = No money)**

Your priority is **NOT** the code. Your priority is the **Store Listing**.

- **Listing:** If nobody finds it, the code doesn't matter.
- **Ratio:** Spend 70% of effort on Distribution/SEO, 30% on Code.

## 1. Keyword Research (The Foundation)
*Don't guess. Cheat.*

### Strategy
1.  **Autocomplete is God:** Type generic terms into CWS search bar (e.g., "YouTube", "Notion", "Block") and see what drops down. Those are money keywords.
2.  **Competitor Theft:** Find the top 3 extensions in your niche.
    - Copy their title.
    - Analyze their description density.
    - **Differentiation:** Add *one* modifier they missed (e.g., "Simple", "Fast", "Privacy-focused", "Dark Mode").
3.  **Long-tail Gold:** Don't fight for "Adblock". Fight for "Adblock for Twitch Low CPU".

### Checklist
- [ ] Identifying 3-5 core keywords with high intent.
- [ ] Main keyword must appear in the first 3 words of the Title.
- [ ] Main keyword must appear in the first sentence of the Description.

## 2. Title & Description (Sell Results, Not Features)
*Users don't care how it works. They care what it gets them.*

### The Title Formula (Max 45 chars preferred, utilize up to 75)
**Stop:** "Super YT Speed Controller v2.0" (Nobody cares)
**Start:** "YouTube Slower - Learn Languages Fast" (Result oriented)

**Template:** `[Main Keyword] + [The Primary Result/Benefit]`

### The Description Formula
**Stop:** Listing technical stacks (React, Vue, permissions).
**Start:** Selling the dream.

**Template:**
1.  **The Hook (Lines 1-2):** State the painful problem. "Tired of wasting hours watching silence in lectures?"
2.  **The Promise:** "Skip silence automatically and save 30 mins per video."
3.  **Social Proof:** "Join 10,000+ students saving time."
4.  **Keyword Stuffing (Artfully):** Weave secondary keywords into natural sentences. "Best speed controller for Chrome..."
5.  **FAQ/Call to Action:** "Install now to start saving time. Free forever."

## 3. Visuals (Screenshot = Use Case)
*If they have to squint to see UI, you lost.*

### The Golden Rule
**Screenshots are advertisements, not documentation.**
- **❌ WRONG:** A raw screenshot of your settings page.
- **❌ WRONG:** A raw screenshot of the popup UI.
- **✅ RIGHT:** A manipulated image showing the **EFFECT** of the extension.

### The "Use Case" Style
1.  **Zoom In:** Zoom in 150-200% on the feature.
2.  **Overlay Text:** Big, bold text explaining the *value* (e.g., "❌ Block Ads" vs "✅ Ads Blocked").
3.  **Before/After:** Split screen. Left side: Pain (Messy). Right side: Pleasure (Clean).
4.  **Annotations:** Use bright red arrows or circles pointing to the result.

**Screenshot 1:** The "Hero" Result. (e.g., A clean YouTube page).
**Screenshot 2:** How easy it is (One click).
**Screenshot 3:** Secondary benefit (Privacy/Speed).

## 4. Distribution Strategy (Update Loop)
*The algorithm loves life.*

### The "Pulse" Method
Chrome Web Store rankings decay if an extension looks abandoned.
- **Action:** Update the listing or the code every 7-10 days.
- **What to update:**
    - Change 1 line in description to target a trending keyword.
    - Tweak a screenshot.
    - Bump version number `1.0.1` -> `1.0.2` with "Performance improvements".

### Reviews = Rank
- **In-App Prompt:** Ask *once* after they get value (e.g., after they block their 100th ad). "Saved you time? Rate us 5 stars."
- **Support:** Reply to EVERY review. It signals activity to the algorithm.

## summary_checklist
1.  **Keyword:** Did you pick keywords from Autocomplete?
2.  **Title:** Does it promise a result?
3.  **Desc:** Does it start with a pain point?
4.  **Screenshots:** Do they show Before/After or zoomed benefits?
5.  **Update:** Do you have a plan to push an update next week?

*Remember: Code is secondary. Distribution is King.*
