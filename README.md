# AI Skills Repository 🧠

**Purpose:**
This repository serves as a centralized knowledge base for **AI Skills** (Context files). Ideally, these skills are "reusable modules" that you can feed to Claude/AI during "Vibe Coding" sessions to enhance its capabilities, enforce standard practices, or inject specialized domain knowledge (like S4 philosophies).

> **Goal:** Accumulate, Refine, and Reuse high-leverage context.
